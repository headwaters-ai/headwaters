# headwaters

Simple stream sources for client application development.

### Install

From [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/headwaters/):

After creating a virtual environment:

```pip install -U headwaters```

then start the default streaming server:

```hw```

The CLI output shows the location of the server and ui.

Streams can be connected to at the server: http://127.0.0.1:5555

To control the streams, view the docs, and access sample code, use the ui running at http://127.0.0.1:5555/ui

Simple as that.
